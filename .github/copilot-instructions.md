# AI Coding Agent Instructions for ABES-CSE-C-AMANYADAV

Welcome to the ABES-CSE-C-AMANYADAV project! This document provides essential guidelines for AI coding agents to be productive in this codebase. Follow these instructions to understand the project's structure, conventions, and workflows.

## Project Overview

This repository contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for various assignments and exercises. The focus is on:
- **Frontend development**: Creating interactive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Educational purposes**: The codebase is structured to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts.

### Key Directories and Files
- `Javascript/`: Contains JavaScript files demonstrating concepts like arrays, loops, classes, and operators.
  - Example: `Javascript/array.html` showcases array manipulation.
- `aman/`: Includes additional resources and text files.
- Root directory: Contains HTML and CSS files for assignments (e.g., `assignment2.html`, `assignment2.css`).

## Development Conventions

### HTML
- Use semantic HTML tags where possible.
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces per level).
- Inline styles are discouraged; prefer external CSS files.

### CSS
- Follow a modular approach by separating styles into dedicated CSS files.
- Use `cursor: pointer;` for interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links).
  - Example: `assignment2.css` and `assignment4.html` use this pattern extensively.

### JavaScript
- Focus on fundamental concepts (e.g., loops, conditionals, arrays).
- Keep scripts simple and self-contained within the HTML files.
- Avoid external dependencies unless necessary.

## Developer Workflows

### Testing and Debugging
- Open HTML files directly in a browser to test functionality.
- Use browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) for debugging.

### Adding New Assignments
1. Create a new HTML file in the appropriate directory.
2. Add corresponding CSS and JavaScript files if needed.
3. Follow the existing naming conventions (e.g., `assignment<number>.html`).

### Example Workflow
To add a new JavaScript example:
1. Create `Javascript/example.html`.
2. Write the JavaScript code inline or link an external `.js` file.
3. Test the file in a browser.

## Notes for AI Agents
- Prioritize readability and simplicity in generated code.
- Align with the educational purpose of the repository.
- Reference existing files for consistent patterns and practices.
